# DevFlow

DevFlow is a **spec-driven development pipeline** that turns a raw idea into a reviewed, tested, and merged feature. Each step maps to a skill (and optional slash command) that defines inputs, steps, outputs, and success criteria.

The workflow is **technology-agnostic**: stack-specific rules live in **adapters** under [`templates/devflow/adapters/`](templates/devflow/adapters/). Today the **Flutter**, **Angular**, and **Next.js** adapters ship with this repo; adding more stacks means adding a new adapter folder and switching [`templates/devflow/config.md`](templates/devflow/config.md).

---

## Pipeline

```
idea
  └── devflow.task
        └── devflow.plan
              └── devflow.analyze  (recommended — cross-artifact consistency check)
                    └── devflow.implement
                          └── devflow.beautify
                                └── devflow.test
                                      └── devflow.ship
                                            └── devflow.pr
```

Each step produces an artifact that feeds the next. Do not skip steps.

## Project docs (in your app repo)

| File | Role | Read by |
|------|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Global agent operating rules (token-lean, setup-managed sections) | setup + all steps (as host memory/context) |
| `REGISTRY.md` | Shared patterns and conventions summary | setup + plan → pr |
| `constitution.md` | Architecture, stack, layout | plan → pr |
| `registry.md` | Shared patterns | plan → pr |
| `docs/product.md` | Product / feature status | task |

`devflow.setup` manages root `AGENTS.md` and `REGISTRY.md` using adapter templates. By default it updates only `devflow-managed` blocks; pass `--force` to overwrite full files.

```

Feature folders (in the consumer project) use zero-padded ids (`001`, `002`, …) and `kebab-case` names confirmed with the user.

---

## Build system

The plugin uses a manifest-driven build: source lives in `templates/devflow/`, built output in `dist/devflow/` (committed). Run the build after any change to skills, adapters, or hooks:

```bash
# Rebuild dist/ after any source change
bash scripts/build-plugin.sh

# Validate all SKILL.md files
bash templates/devflow/scripts/validate-skills.sh
```

The build is **idempotent** — it recreates `dist/devflow/` from scratch on every run. Requires `jq` (`brew install jq`).

---

## Plugins (Claude Code & Cursor)

The [`dist/devflow/`](dist/devflow/) folder is a **dual-marketplace plugin**: same tree loads in Claude Code and Cursor.

### Install via Claude Code marketplace (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add Gabriele-bil/dev_flow
/plugin install devflow@devflow
```

Skills are namespaced — use them as `/devflow:task`, `/devflow:plan`, etc.

### Install locally (Claude Code)

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./dist/devflow
```

### Install locally (Cursor)

Symlink `~/.cursor/plugins/local/devflow` → this repo's `dist/devflow` directory, then reload the window — see [Plugins](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins).

More detail: [`templates/devflow/README.md`](templates/devflow/README.md).

### Recommended companion plugin: code-review-graph

Use `code-review-graph` for blast-radius aware reviews in both Cursor and Claude with one setup:

- `pipx install code-review-graph` (or `pip install code-review-graph`)
- `code-review-graph install` (auto-detects configured platforms including Cursor and Claude Code)
- `code-review-graph build` (initial graph indexing per repository)

### Required MCP baseline

| Adapter | MCP servers |
|---------|-------------|
| Angular | `context7`, `sequential-thinking` |
| Flutter | `context7`, `sequential-thinking`, `dart`, `supabase` |
| Next.js | `context7`, `sequential-thinking` |

---

## Agents

Specialized agents live in [`templates/devflow/agents/`](templates/devflow/agents/) and are dispatched automatically by `devflow.ship`:

| Agent | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Code Reviewer | [`agents/code-reviewer.md`](templates/devflow/agents/code-reviewer.md) | 5-axis code review: correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance |
| Security Auditor | [`agents/security-auditor.md`](templates/devflow/agents/security-auditor.md) | Exploitable vulnerabilities, threat modeling, secure coding |
| Test Engineer | [`agents/test-engineer.md`](templates/devflow/agents/test-engineer.md) | Coverage gap analysis, test strategy, test quality |
| Accessibility Auditor | [`agents/accessibility-auditor.md`](templates/devflow/agents/accessibility-auditor.md) | WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard/focus, screen readers, contrast, touch targets |
| Docs Reviewer | [`agents/docs-reviewer.md`](templates/devflow/agents/docs-reviewer.md) | Public API coverage, README/CHANGELOG sync, plan traceability |

`devflow.ship` runs all five in parallel, synthesizes reports into a Ship Gate Report, and routes to `devflow.pr` only if no blockers are found.
